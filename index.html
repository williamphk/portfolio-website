                      Battleship is a guessing game played by two players. Each
                      player has a game board with ships arranged on it, and
                      they take turns guessing the locations of the opponent's
                      ships. The first player to sink all of their opponent's
                      ships wins the game.

                    <p class="project-description">
                      To play the game, first arrange your ships on the game
                      board. You can do this by dragging and dropping them onto
                      the board. Once you have placed your ships, click the
                      "Start Game" button to begin. On your turn, click a cell
                      on your opponent's board to guess if there is a ship
                      there. If you hit a ship, a red "X" will appear on the
                      cell. If you miss, a dot will appear on the cell. The game
                      ends when one player has sunk all of their opponent's
                      ships.
