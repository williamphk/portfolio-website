            I am studying Web Development at Humber College, Toronto, Canada,
            where I have been learning and refining my skills in various
            programming languages, frameworks, and tools. I have a unique
            background in the construction industry, but my passion for coding
            and creating impactful digital experiences led me to pursue a career
            in web development.
          </p>
          <p class="self-introduction">
            I invite you to explore my portfolio and learn more about my
            projects, skills, and experiences. Thank you for visiting my
            website, and I look forward to connecting with you!
